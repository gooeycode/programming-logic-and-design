12. Glen Ross Vacation Property Sales employs seven salespeople, as shown in Table 6-8.
When a salesperson makes a sale, a
record is created, including the date,
time, and dollar amount of the sale. The
time is expressed in hours and minutes,
based on a 24-hour clock. The sale
amount is expressed in whole dollars.
Salespeople earn a commission that
differs for each sale, based on the rate
schedule in Table 6-9.
