6. a. Watson Elementary School contains 30 classrooms numbered 1 through 30.
Each classroom can contain any number of students up to 35. Each student
takes an achievement test at the end of the school year and receives a score
from 0 through 100. 

Write a program that accepts data for each student in the
schoolâ€”student ID, classroom number, and score on the achievement test.

Design a program that lists the total points scored for each of the 30 classrooms.

b. Modify the Watson Elementary School program so that the average of the test
scores is output for each classroom, rather than total scores for each classroom.
