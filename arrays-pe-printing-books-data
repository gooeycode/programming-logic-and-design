4. a. Registration workers at a conference for authors of children’s books have
collected data about conference participants, including the number of books
each author has written and the target age of their readers. The participants have
written from 1 to 40 books each, and target readers’ ages range from 0 through 16.

Design a program that continuously accepts an author’s name, number of books
written, and target reader age until a sentinel value is entered. Then display a list of
how many participants have written each number of books (1 through 40).

declerations
	num sub;

	string name;
	num bookTotal;
	num targetAge;
	string names[];
	num book[];
	num age[];
	num totalName;

housekeeping()
	output "please enter authors name, number of books written, and target age of their readers";
	input name, bookTotal, targetAge

detailLoop()
// filling the array
	sub = 0
	while (name != QUIT) {
		name = names[sub];
		noOfBooks = book[sub]
		targetAge = age[sub];
		sub = sub + 1
		output "please enter authors name, number of books written, and target age of their readers";
		input name, noOfBooks, targetAge
	}end while
	totalName = sub;

//display array of name and eachbook amount
	sub = 0;
	while (sub <= totalName) {
		output "authour " + name[sub] + "has " + books[sub] + "books published ";
		sub = sub + 1
		}end while


b. Modify the author registration program so that the output is a list of how many
participants have written 1 to 5 books, 6 to 12 books, and 13 or more books.

	bookSub = TOTALBOOKS - 1

			output "number of authors with" + book_total[sub] + " is " + total_books_count[sub];
		sub = sub + 1
		}end while
endOfJob()
	output "thank you for using this program"



c. Modify the author registration program so that the output is a count of the
number of books written for each of the following age groups: under 3, 3 through
7, 8 through 10, 11 through 13, and 14 and older.
