# -logic-and-design
all logic and design documentation from 2021 - 2022. youre welcome

this respository will serve as a hub for all the pseudocode, charts, wireframes i have written
to become a programmer with good logic & design.

when i made the decision to become a programmer, i quickly became aware that learning a 
programming languages syntax is not the way to go; i didnt want to be no copy and paste kinda
progammer, i wanted to be able to really think about how to write code to solve problems.

in the final research analysis, i concluded learning the logic and design of programs
is the best way to learn how to be a programmer (the program development cycle backed me up here),
and with that, i decided to use the past 9 months learning the theory of creating programs
and doing exercise as practice.

here is the evidence of the practice to my theory, i hope you enjoy reading my code.
