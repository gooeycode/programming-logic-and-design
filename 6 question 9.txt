9. Design a program that computes					Weekly Gross Pay ($) 		Withholding Percentage (%)
pay for employees.									0.00–300.00 				10
Allow a user to continuously						300.01–550.00 				13
input employees’ names until						550.01–800.00 				16
an appropriate sentinel value						800.01 and up 				20
is entered. Also input each
employee’s hourly wage and
hours worked. Compute each employee’s gross pay (hours times rate), withholding
tax percentage (based on Table 6-5), withholding tax amount, and net pay
(gross pay minus withholding tax). 
Display all the results for each employee.
After the last employee has been entered, display the sum of all the hours
worked, the total gross payroll, the total withholding for all employees, and the
total net payroll.
